# OVERVIEW 
This is a WINDOWS application that records what tasks you were working on.
Each window change is recorded, and the longest used window in a 15 minute period gets added to the day's total.
A day's summary is provided where each application is listed once with the cumulative time worked on it all day.

This was meant to help me keep track of what I did each day so I could record it on my timesheets.

## TODO:
* Tie in mouse and keyboard actions to ensure you're actually interacting with the computer.
* Create a test that properly checks if the current time is retreived.
* Create a test that will verify the system is locked (how do you recover from this without human intervention?)
* Create a test that will verify the system is unlocked

## KNOWN ISSUES:
* There is no attempt made to identify an application that is left open while you walk away and talk to your colleague, so beware of that.
